Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
**TensorFlow:**
- Static computation graphs (define-and-run)
- Production-ready, excellent deployment tools
- Strong industry adoption
- Keras API for simplified development

**PyTorch:**
- Dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run)
- More Pythonic, intuitive debugging
- Preferred for research and prototyping
- Faster iteration during development

**When to choose:**
- TensorFlow: Production systems, mobile deployment, enterprise applications
- PyTorch: Research projects, rapid prototyping, academic work
