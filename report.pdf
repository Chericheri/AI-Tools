Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
TensorFlow:
- Static computation graphs (define-and-run)
- Production-ready, excellent deployment tools
- Strong industry adoption
- Keras API for simplified development

PyTorch:
- Dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run)
- More Pythonic, intuitive debugging
- Preferred for research and prototyping
- Faster iteration during development

When to choose:
- TensorFlow: Production systems, mobile deployment, enterprise applications
- PyTorch: Research projects, rapid prototyping, academic work


Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Interactive data visualization and statistical analysis
2. Model Prototyping: Quick iteration and experimentation with different architectures
3. Educational Demonstrations: Combining code, visualizations, and explanations
4. Collaborative Research: Sharing reproducible experiments with colleagues


Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
Basic String Operations:
- Simple pattern matching
- Limited to exact string matches
- No linguistic understanding

spaCy Advantages:
- Linguistic intelligence (understanding grammar, syntax)
- Named Entity Recognition (identify people, organizations, locations)
- Dependency parsing (understanding relationships between words)
- Pre-trained models for multiple languages
- Efficient processing of large text volumes


2. Comparative Analysis

Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:

Target applications (e.g., classical ML vs. deep learning).
- Scikit-learn: Classical ML (SVMs, decision trees, clustering)
- TensorFlow: Deep Learning (neural networks, computer vision, NLP)


Ease of use for beginners.
- Scikit-learn: Very easy, consistent API, minimal setup
- TensorFlow: Steeper learning curve, but Keras API simplifies it


Community support.
- Scikit-learn: Excellent documentation, many examples
- TensorFlow: Massive community, extensive tutorials, enterprise support


Part 3: Ethics & Optimization
Ethical Analysis

Potential Biases Identified:

MNIST Model:
- Cultural bias: Handwriting styles vary across cultures
- Age bias: Older vs younger handwriting patterns
- Educational bias: Literacy levels affect digit writing

Amazon Reviews Model:
- Language bias: English-only analysis excludes non-English speakers
- Product bias: Tech products overrepresented
- Geographic bias: Western consumer preferences dominant

Mitigation Strategies:

1. TensorFlow Fairness Indicators:
   - Analyze performance across different demographic segments
   - Identify accuracy disparities between groups
   - Implement fairness constraints during training

2. spaCy Rule-based Improvements:
   - Add multilingual support
   - Include diverse product categories
   - Implement contextual sentiment analysis

3. Data Augmentation:
   - Include diverse handwriting samples
   - Add reviews from various geographic regions
   - Balance product categories
